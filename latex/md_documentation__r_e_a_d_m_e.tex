Project made with C++. It will run in terminal, requires compiling, then run {\itshape prog}.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Game Setup
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Board size
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 10x10
\item The columns are denoted by letters (A-\/J)
\item The rows are denoted by number (1-\/10)
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Number of ships (per player)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Given by user
\item Minimum of 1 and a maximum of 6
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Types of ships
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This will be based on the amount of ships chosen.
\item If a total of 1 ship is chosen, then each player gets a single 1x1 ship
\item If a total of 2 ships is chosen, then each player gets a 1x1 and a 1x2 ship
\item This continues up to 6, where each player will a 1x1, 1x2, 1x3, 1x4, and a 1x6 ship
\item Ships are denoted by ‘o’ on the board.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Ship placement
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item After the amount of ships is chosen, players are able to secretly orient and place the ships on their board.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Playing the Game
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Each player will have 2 boards. A ship board and a shot board.
\item Taking turns, players will pick a space on the opponent\textquotesingle{}s board to \char`\"{}fire\char`\"{} at.
\item They are then informed if the shot was a \char`\"{}hit\char`\"{} or a \char`\"{}miss\char`\"{}.
\item The player\textquotesingle{}s shot board is updated to reflect this.
\item The shot board will show a ‘0’ if the shot missed or an ‘\+X’ if the shot hit. Similarly, the ship board will show an ‘!’ if the opponent’s shot hit the ship.
\item After each shot, it is the other player\textquotesingle{}s turn.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Destroying a ship
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Once a ship has been hit in every space it occupies, it is sunk.
\item For example, if the 1x3 ship occupies the space B3, B4, and B5.
\item Once the opponent has shot those three spaces, that ship is sunk.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Game End
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Once a player has sunk all of the opponent\textquotesingle{}s ships, they immediately win.
\end{DoxyItemize}
